flight_scrapper
===============

This is a quick script that I reversed engineered in order to poll ITA Matrix Airfare Search. It is still a bit rough around the edges as I try to clean it up. The ultimate goal of this is for me to monitor usage on flight fares for certain days of the weeks for multiple weeks and have it alert me on good deals. I'll eventually add some cool graphics and charts and build myself a dashboard that I can then use to display on a picture frame or something. Anyways, I hope someone else out there finds this useful.

The ITA Matrix Airfare Search is a great tool so I suggest you go check it out here: http://matrix.itasoftware.com/
